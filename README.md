## 📦 Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

Use this link to open the repository in HACS and click on Download

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=ArikShemesh&repository=ha-simple-timer)

⚠️ If you previously added this integration as a custom repository in HACS, it's recommended to remove the custom entry and reinstall it from the official HACS store.
You will continue to receive updates in both cases, but switching ensures you're aligned with the official listing and avoids potential issues in the future.

### Manual Installation
1. Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ArikShemesh/ha-simple-timer/releases)
2. Extract the `custom_components/simple_timer` folder to your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory
3. **Restart Home Assistant**
4. **Note:** You do **NOT** need to add the dashboard resource manually. It is automatically registered when the integration starts.

**That's it!** The timer card is automatically installed and ready to use.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Add Integration Instance
1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services**
2. Click **"Add Integration"**
3. Search for **"Simple Timer"**
4. Select the device you want to control (switch, light, fan, input_boolean, climate)
5. Give your timer instance a descriptive name (e.g., "Kitchen Timer", "Water Heater")
6. **Climate entities only:** choose the mode to use when turning on (Heat, Cool, Dry, …). The list comes from the entity itself, and only that mode is applied - the timer always switches the device off at the end
7. Choose notification entitiy (optional) - can be add more than one
8. Check show seconds (optional) - display seconds in uasge time and notifications

> A climate entity that offers no **off** mode cannot be selected - a timer that
> cannot turn the device off again would be worse than no timer.

### Add Timer Card to Dashboard
1. **Edit your dashboard**
2. **Add a card**
3. Search for **"Simple Timer Card"** (should appear in the card picker)
4. **Configure the card:**
   - Select your timer instance
   - Customize timer buttons
   - Add a custom card title (optional)
   - Enable **Show Schedule Panel** to let users schedule a future start (off by default)
  
## 🔄 Renaming Timer Instances

### ✅ Recommended Method
1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services**  
2. Find your Simple Timer integration
3. Click **Configure** (⚙️ gear icon)
4. Change the name and save

### 💡 Note on 3-Dots Rename
If you use the 3-dots menu to rename, open **Configure** once afterward to sync the change.

## ⏱️ Schedule Timer

Enable **Show Schedule Panel** in the card editor to add a collapsible "Schedule Timer" panel:

- Pick a **start time** and **run-for** duration (free input + quick-fill from your preset buttons).
- **One-shot** (next occurrence) or **Repeat** on selected days of the week.
- Once set, the card shows a banner ("Starts … · runs …"); ✕ cancels it.
- Survives Home Assistant restarts. On a reverse-mode card, the schedule runs as a normal bounded timer (start at the time, auto-off after the duration).

Disabled by default - existing cards are unchanged until you turn it on.

## 📜 History & Activity

Each timer instance exposes a **Status** sensor (`sensor.<name>_status_<id>`) alongside the runtime sensor. Its state is one of `idle`, `active`, `delayed_start`, or `scheduled`.

This is what makes the timer show up in Home Assistant's **logbook** and in the **Activity** feed on the device page. The runtime sensor cannot do that job: it reports a number of seconds, and the logbook deliberately skips numeric sensors so it isn't flooded with readings.

Entries read naturally and name whoever triggered them:

```
9:08 PM   Water Heater   started for 30 minutes by Alex
9:05 PM   Water Heater   finished - device turned off, daily usage 45 minutes
6:00 AM   Water Heater   scheduled for 18:00 (30 minutes), repeating by Alex
```

Actions the integration takes on its own - a timer expiring, a schedule firing - are intentionally left unattributed rather than credited to the person who set them up hours earlier.

### Opening history from the card

**Press and hold the countdown display** (or the progress bar) for about a second. This opens the status entity's more-info dialog, showing its state timeline and logbook.

There is no icon for this - it's a hidden gesture, so it's worth knowing it exists. It works in every countdown display mode, since the hold is bound to the countdown text and the progress bar alike.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I have multiple timer instances?
Yes! Add multiple integrations for different devices.

### Does the timer work if Home Assistant restarts?
Yes, active timers resume automatically with offline time compensation. Scheduled starts also survive restarts (recurring schedules re-arm; a missed one-shot is dropped).

### Can I have multiple timer cards?
Yes! You can add multiple cards for the same timer instance on different dashboards (or the same one). They will stay synchronized.

### How to trigger a timer with automation?
You can use the `simple_timer.start_timer` service in your automations or scripts.

```yaml
triggers:
  - at: "10:00:00"
    trigger: time
actions:
  - data:
      entry_id: your_entry_id # Find this in the entity attributes (e.g.: 01KDQ6WPZDBB3EB89DX407GR6M)
      duration: 30
      unit: s
      reverse_mode: false
    action: simple_timer.start_timer
```

### How to schedule a timer for a future time?
Use the card's **Schedule Timer** panel, or the `simple_timer.schedule_timer` service:

```yaml
action: simple_timer.schedule_timer
data:
  entry_id: your_entry_id      # or entity_id: sensor.your_timer_runtime_...
  start_time: "21:30:00"
  duration: 30
  unit: min
  repeat: true                 # optional; daily/recurring
  days: [mon, tue, wed, thu, fri]   # optional; empty = every day
```
Cancel an armed schedule with `simple_timer.cancel_schedule` (same `entry_id`/`entity_id`).

### Can I control my A/C or Climate entity?
Yes, directly. Select the climate entity when you add the integration instance,
and pick the mode it should run in.

**What "on" means.** A switch is on or off. A climate entity has no "on" - its
state *is* its mode (`heat`, `cool`, `dry`, `fan_only`, `auto`, `heat_cool`, or
`off`). So you choose one mode when you set the timer up, and that is what the
timer applies. Turning off is always `off`.

**Any non-off mode counts as running.** The device is metered, and the card
shows it as on, in every mode. That has three consequences worth knowing:

- **Changing the mode during a timer does not cancel it.** Start a 2 hour timer
  in `cool`, switch the unit to `heat` by hand, and the timer keeps running -
  the device is still on, and that is what the timer is counting.
- **Turning the device off does cancel it**, the same as with a switch.
- **A unit that goes `unavailable` does not cancel it.** An entity that stopped
  answering has not told us it is off, and losing a timer to a dropped Zigbee
  message would be worse than waiting.

**Starting a timer on a unit that is already running leaves its mode alone.**
The configured mode is applied when the device is off. The one exception is a
delayed start: when it fires, it applies the configured mode, because "turn it
on at 21:30" has to mean something specific.

> **Upgrading with a cached card?** A browser holding an old card bundle shows a
> climate timer as off and its power button may not work. Hard-refresh
> (Ctrl+Shift+R) once.

The old workaround - an `input_boolean` helper plus an automation - still works
and is no longer needed. It is only worth keeping if your automation does more
than turn the unit on and off, for example setting a target temperature.

### Can I customize the timer buttons?
Yes! You can configure values with explicit units. Example: `timer_buttons: [30, "45s", "1.5h", "1d"]`. 

### Why does my usage show a warning message?
This appears when HA was offline during a timer to indicate potential time sync issues.

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Card Not Appearing in Card Picker

1. **Restart Home Assistant:** The card is installed during integration setup
2. **Check integration logs:** Look for any errors during the card installation process
3. **Verify automatic installation:** Check if `/config/www/simple-timer/timer-card.js` exists
4. **Clear browser cache:** Hard refresh with Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
5. **Check browser console:** Press F12 and look for JavaScript errors

### Timer Not Working

1. **Check device entity:** Ensure the controlled device exists and is accessible
2. **Verify integration setup:** Go to Settings → Devices & Services → Simple Timer
3. **Check logs:** Look for errors in Settings → System → Logs
4. **Restart integration:** Remove and re-add the integration if needed

### Daily Usage Not Tracking

1. **Device state changes:** Timer only tracks when the device is actually ON
2. **Manual control:** If you turn the device off manually, tracking stops (by design)
3. **Midnight reset:** Usage resets at 00:00 each day automatically

### Card Installation Issues

If the automatic card installation fails:
1. **Check file permissions:** Ensure Home Assistant can write to the `www` directory
2. **Verify disk space:** Ensure sufficient space for file copying
3. **Check integration logs:** Look for specific error messages
4. **Manual fallback:** You can still manually copy the card file from the integration's `dist` folder

### Card Not Updating After Upgrade

If you don't see new features (like the Default Timer option) after updating:
1. **Clear browser cache:** Hard refresh with Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. **Reload Resources:** Call the `simple_timer.reload_resources` service from Developer Tools → Services to force the frontend to load the latest version.
